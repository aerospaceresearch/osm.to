# Ground Control Point

Hi, you have found a GroundControlPoint. It is used to geo-reference aerial images.

This particular one has an OSM shortlink, which is a calculated coordinate. This one links to the [City of Jena, Germany](https://osm.org/go/0MAc8pQ-)

To find out more, how they work and how to use them, have a look at the [gcp-osm project page](https://github.com/aerospaceresearch/gcp-osm).
